    <h1>Lab 10: Javascript Events and Forms</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Our challenge we had was getting our JavaScript file to run properly in the console with no errors. It kept reading that
    there was a "uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'addEventListener')" and we did
    not know how to fix it. However, we later forgot that when naming our variables, we had to put var. When we did that we kept
  	getting undefined in the first line of our javascript file.
    </p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>We had problems in making our JavaScript file work. It was mainly one section that we had conflict with which
    is sorting the inputted name that the user would enter on our webpage.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
