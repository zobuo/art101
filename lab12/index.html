        Challenges
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of the challenges we encountered was that our sortingHat function was not working as intended intially.
        We realized though that we did not use "else if" for each of the conditionals. We were using just else.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Problems
      </h2>
      <p>
        We had a problem with getting the house names to return, but later realized that we needed to use two equals
        signs within the conditionals.
