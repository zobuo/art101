        Challenges
      </h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge we faced was figuring out how to print our results on our webpage. We were trying to implement
        some of the methods listed in the assigment, but got stuck in the process. We later realized that we were missing
        the # in front of all the output calls within our JavaScript, which was causing this issue. 
      </p>
      <h2>
        Problems
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of the problems we had was that our output was not printing the numbers that were not being associated with
        "Fizz", "Buzz", and "Boom". We realized that we did not inlcude a # next to output within our conditional. Another
        problem that we had was that our results were not showing up when we clicked the button. However, we figured out
        that by adding "onclick" within our button tag it prints the results when the button gets clicked.
