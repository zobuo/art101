      <h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools and Strategies</h1>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>We found it challenging to choose something to help debug as there were many to choose from.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We initially thought to stop debugging after fixing on of the variables and found another bug. However, we quikcly realized
      that it is best ot run it in the console again and we were able to find another problem which we eventually solved.</p>

      <h2>Debugging</h2>
      <p>We debugged by first implementing the code that was originally written in StackOverflow in our console. Once we
      saw what was wrong, we fixed one of the variables "theArray" to "array" as they did not define a new variable when they called
      it. We ran this again a second time and found another bug in the code as "i++" was not definied as their previous variable
      was "index." After running this, we were able to see that there were no more errors.</p>
