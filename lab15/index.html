      <h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>We struggled with understanding the APIs given in the canvas assignment document. For example, we looked at the Star
      Wars and Fortune Cookie API and got a little confused on reading them both.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We had a difficult time understanding what APIs were and functions when initially reading them. Therefore,
      we had to spend extra time understanding it and had to re-read the slides multiple times.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Here are our results!</p>
