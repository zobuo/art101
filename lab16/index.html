      <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs</h1>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>We had some misunderstandings as to what the api key objects were in Task 4 in the Canvas assignment.</p>

      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>We had a few complications after our files were ready for testing because we could not see our results when we clicked
      the activate button. We realized that we forgot to enable our Chrome extensions for the JSON and CORS.</p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Here are our results!</p>
