	<h1>Check Us Out</h1>
	<p>Hi! I'm Zac, and I am a sophomore majoring in Games and Playable Media. I am affiliated with Kresge, and living there
		as well. Some things I enjoy to do are play video games with friends (currently hard stuck gold in Valorant), play basketball,
		and listen to Ariana Grande. In relation to what I am studying, I am still trying to figure out what I enjoy most within the
		field of game design, but as of now I enjoy writing the most.

		Hello, I am Pichy and I am a second year majoring in Games and Playable Media with a minor in Earth Sciences.
		I currently live at College Nine Apartments and I love to cook, sleep, and listen to music while in my room. Aside from that,
	 	some of my interests include creating art, reading comics, playing games, and watching movies/tv shows, and working out
		when I have the time.

	<h2>Fun Facts About Zac</h2>
	<p>I have an almost twin sister who is adopted from China (she's exactly one week younger than me). On a really good day
		I am about 6'2, but most of the time I am only 5'6. Also, I am a simp for Ariana Grande.
	</p>

	<h2>Fun Facts About Pichy</h2>
	<p>I have watched over 20 tv shows ranging from Marvel, Star Wars, Netflix series, Hulu series, and more! I have watched
		Parks and Recreation many times and can recite the lines before it is even said! I am currently working on a comic for a class
	  and although I am quite nervous, I hope that it turns out great! I love comic books and go to Atlantis Comics downtown almost
	  every week. I also love to watch animal documentaries especially about marine life. I used to be a marine biology major
	  but switched because I could not do chemistry.
