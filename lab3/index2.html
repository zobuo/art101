  <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
  <p>The subject of this lab was to create a file structure on my computer and learn to trasfer those files</p>
  <h2>Difficulties</h2>
  <p>We had some challenges in regards to centering our two images side by side as for awhile our images were stacked
    onto one another. In terms of working Teletype, we had difficulty with joining each other's portal and when we did, we
    had some errors as we were not able to see each other's changes. Additionally, we were also confused on the links to
    our labs. Instead of having it link to a broken link, we decided to link them to our github.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Here is the result of our file structure</p>
