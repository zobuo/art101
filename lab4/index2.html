  <h1>Challenge</h1>
  <p>The challenge that this lab presented was coming up with a high-level pseudocode list.
    It was challenging at first to think of steps that were not too simple, but also clear and
    easy to understand.
  </p>
  <h1>Problems</h1>
  <p>One of the problems we faced initially was that we used unordered-list of an ordered-list within our index.html
    file for describing our high-level list. It caused some formatting issues, but we later realized
    that we should have used an ordered-list.
  </p>
  <h1>Results</h1>
  <p>We were quite happy with our results as they matched what was asked for on the Canvas page.
    We did not want our webpage looking bare, so we decided to change up the colors so that it matched
    up with the steps we were describing. Although extremely simple, we liked that we added color and
    changed the alignment of our text to make it more appealing.

  <p><u>Our pseudocode using the "pre" tag:</u></p>
  <pre><code>
    Print the board
      Loop through each row
        If the space is empty and not interfering with another Queen, place a Queen
        If not, print error message
      Return all possible solutions
  </pre></<code>

  <p><u>Our pseudocode list of an everyday task:</u></p>
  <ol type="1">
  	 <li>Make sure you have your student id and mask.</li>
  	 <li>Take any of the metro busses to downtown, except the 22. Make sure the bus doesn't say "LOOP".</li>
  	 <li>Get off at the metro station, which is the very last stop.</li>
  	 <li>Go north up Front St. until you arrive at Front St. and Soquel Ave.</li>
		 <li>You made it! Have fun shopping!</li>
  </ol>

  <p><u>Our pseudocode list of a computer task:</u></p>
  <ol type="1">
		<li>Print the board.</li>
		<li>Take the user input.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Input any number</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Validate the user input.</li>
		<li>Evaluate available spaces on the board.</li>
		<li>Print all possible solutions.</li>
	</ol>
