  <h1>Challenge</h1>
  <p>Our biggest challenge was getting our Teletype to work correctly so we can work side by side.</p>
  <h1>Problems</h1>
  <p>We did not know what undefined meant, so we were confused when our console output said "undefined". This led
  us to google what undefined meant and if we were doing it correctly.</p>
  <h1>Results</h1>
  <p>Here is our output!</p>
  <h3>Script Output</h3>
   <div class=output>
     <script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
