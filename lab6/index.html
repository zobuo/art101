	<h1>Challenge</h1>
	<p>We were confused why we got something undefined in the output when we were checking our elements in our arrays disabled
	through referencing them. Then, we remembered that for indexes, they begin at 0.</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>Our WiFi cut out for a few minutes and we thought that we would not work on it together, however we ended up waiting a
	few minutes in order to connect again.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>Here are our results of our working file!</p>
