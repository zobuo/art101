			 <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
			 <h2>Challenges</h2>
			 <p>One challenge we had was not being able to see the JavaScript in our webpage. However, we realized that this problem
				 occured because we did not inlcude our index or css file. To fix this issue, we tested our files in the console instead.
				 There was also some confusion about the differences between the output of sort and join, but we realized when printing
				 it out on the console what those differences entailed</p>
			 <h2>Problems</h2>
			 <p>We did not really run into any problems in particular, but more so challenges that we eventually found the
				 solutions to.</p>
			 <h2>Results</h2>
			 <p>Check out the results of our working function!</p>
