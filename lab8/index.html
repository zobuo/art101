		 	  <h1>Lab 8: Call Functions and Callbacks</h1>
	      <h2>Challenges</h2>
	      <p>When writing our function in the javascript file, we did not know why (function(num)) did not work and
        realized that javascript is not like python, therefore the closing parentheses should go after the curly brace.
				</p>
	      <h2>Problems</h2>
	      <p>We had problems with understanding callback functions and task x because although we were following
        the steps on W3Schools, we did not understand how it could work for our code.</p>
	      <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Check out the console for our results!</p>
