    <h1>Lab 9: Javascript For The Web</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>We struggled to figure out how to implement the various methods, such as appendChild. We kept running into an
    error in our console that stated that it could not read the properties of null.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>We had a lot of problems when trying to make our results print correctly in the console as it stated
    that we either had reference errors or unknown type errors. Because it does not tell us what
    specifically to change, we realized that we could not randomly put it in the console, but it had to be
    within a certain website.</p>
